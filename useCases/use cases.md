# Data structures and their use cases

Implementing a simulation may seem difficult if you don't have experience working with a real-world use case you're trying to simulate.

Tick anyone you've successfully simulated or you've had experience working with.

## Linked List

Suitable for scenarios where the size of the data is not fixed, and efficient insertion or deletion is priority.

- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Music and Video Playlists
- Undo Functionality in Software (Stack)
- Symbol Table in Compilers
- Task Scheduling in Operating Systems
- Managing File Systsems
- Browser History ✅
- Network Routing Tables

## Stack

When you need to manage data in a Last-in-First-Out (LIFO) manner.

- Function call stack
- Undo Mechanism
- Expression Evaluation
- Postfix Expression Evaluation
- Depth-First Search (Traversal)
- Backtracking Algorithms
- Managing Recursive Algorithms
- Browser History
- Balanced parentheses checking
- Syntax Parsing
- Network Routing Algorithms

## Queue

Suitable for scenarios where elements need to be processed in a sequential order or FIFO manner

- Breadth-first search (Traversal)
- Task scheduling
- Print queue (Printer Spooler)
- Order processing
- Buffering in networking
- Call center systems
- Web server request handling
- Background task processing
- Message queues in distributed systems
- Synchronization in multithreading ✅

- Bank customer service
- Order fufillment in warehouses
- Event handling in GUI applications.

## Hash Table (Maps)

Suitable for scenarios where efficient key-based retrieval of data is a significant concern.

- Databases and Caching ✅
- Symbol Tables in Compilers
- Routing Tables in Networking
- Associative Arrays ✅
- Caching ✅
- Memoization in Dynamic Programming
- Counting Frequencies ✅
- Session Management in Server applications ✅
- Indexing and Searching
- Configuration Management ✅
- Graph Algorithms
- Error Checking and Correction
- Data deduplication ✅
- Geospatial applications
- Serialization and Deserialization

## Tree

The structure of a tree is recursive, and it's <u>commonly used in various applications **to represent hierarchical relationships**</u>.

- **Directory Structures:** Representing file system directory structures where each node is a directory of file.
- Hierarchichal Relationships
- **Expression Trees:** Representing mathematical expressions in a tree structure for parsing and evaluation.
- Decision Trees
- Syntax Trees in Programming Languages
- Binary Search Trees in Databases
- **Routing Tables in Networking:** Efficiently organizing and retrieving routing information in computer networks.
- **Game Trees:** Representing the possible moves and outcomes in games like chess.
- HTML DOM: Representing the structure of HTML documents in web development.
- XML
- HTML and XML Parsing
- Heap Data Structure
- **Trie Data Structure:** Representing and efficiently searching for strings or words in applications like spell checkers or autocomplete features.
- Database Indexing
- Compression Algorithms: (e.g. Huffman coding)
- **Representation of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST):** In compilers and interpreters, representing the abstract syntax of programming language constructs.

The specific type of tree used for in these cases depend on the requirements of the problem being solved.
