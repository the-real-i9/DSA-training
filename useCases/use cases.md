# Data structures and their use cases
Implementing a simulation may seem difficult if you don't have experience working with a real-world use case you're trying to simulate.

Tick anyone you've successfully simulated or you've had experience working with.

## Linked List
Suitable for scenarios where the size of the data is not fixed, and efficient insertion or deletion is priority.
