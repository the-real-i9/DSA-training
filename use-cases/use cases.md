# Data structures Use Cases
You might find it hard to create a simulation until you've actually used or worked with them yourself. i.e. being very familiar with how they actually operate.

Tick anyone you've successfully simulated or used applied for real.

## Linked List
Suitable for scenarios where the size of the data is not fixed, and efficient insertion or deletion is a priority.
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Music and Video Playlists
- Undo Functionality in Software
- Symbol Table in Compilers
- Task Scheduling in Operating Systems
- Managing File Systsems
- Browser History ✅
- Network Routing Tables

## Stack
When you need to manage data in a Last-in-First-Out (LIFO) manner.
- Function call stack
- Undo Mechanism
- Expression Evaluation
- Postfix Expression Evaluation
- Backtracking Algorithms
- Browser History
- Balanced parentheses checking
- Syntax Parsing
- Network Routing Algorithms

## Queue
Suitable for scenarios where elements need to be processed in a sequential order or FIFO manner
- Breadth-First Search (Traversal)
- Task Scheduling
- Print Queue (Printer Spooler)
- Order Processing
- Buffering in Networking
- Call Center Systems
- Web Server Request Handling 
- Background Task Processing
- Message Queues in Distributed Systems
- Synchronization in Multithreading ✅

## Hash Table (Maps)
Suitable for scenarios where efficient key-based retrieval of data is a significant concern.
- Databases and Caching ✅
- Symbol Tables in Compilers
- Routing Tables in Networking
- Associative Arrays ✅
- Caching ✅
- Memoization in Dynamic Programming
- Counting Frequencies ✅
- Session Management in Server applications ✅
- Indexing and Searching
